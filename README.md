# My Vim config

Repo for my Vim configuration ifles, plus a script to install/deploy them.

Read and take what you wish! (BSD-licensed)

## Installation on UNIX environment (including Cygwin)
It should simply be a matter of running:
```bash
$ ./install.sh
```
from a Bash prompt.

## Installation on a Windows environment
For Windows, only administrators are allowed to create symlinks, so you will need to become an Administrator first.

Then, you can move into the folder and type:
```bat
install
```
or
```bat
.\install
```
if you're feeling paranoid.
