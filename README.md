# Some Gray .dotfiles

Repo for my dotfiles, plus a script to install/deploy them.
I will add more dotfiles as I get around to it.

Read and take what you wish! (BSD-licensed)

## Installation
It should simply be a matter of running the:
```bash
$ ./install.sh
```
file from a Bash prompt.

On UNIX environments I symlink the appropriate paths to the files in this repo,
but for Cygwin/Windows, I prefer to just copy them over and be done with it.
